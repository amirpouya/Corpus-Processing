<seg id="3"> Washington 22-11 (AFP)-A district in Maryland State (East) near Washington voted for one of the strictest smoking laws ever. The new law approved severe punishment for people who smoke inside their own houses if their smoke annoys the neighbors. </seg>

<seg id="5"> In cases where cigarette smoke leaks into a neighbor's house through a door, window or ventilation system, the neighbor has the right to file a lawsuit before the Environmental Protection Agency in the district. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He clarified that Iraq had released all the prisoners of the war, numbering 6,222 persons, including eight members of the ruling family in Kuwait. He added that Iraq had received three representatives of the Arab League and accepted the decision of the Ministerial Council of the League in 1999 to establish a mechanism to press this matter, in addition to initiatives from a number of Arab heads of state. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="5"> Al-Hadithi asserted that the latest point accepted by Iraq to conclude this matter was an initiative proposed by Italy to bring together Iraq, Kuwait and the International Committee of the Red Cross to study the matter of the missing persons following Kuwait's agreement to it.

He also learnt of the current state of the industry, in so far as the new employments in this sector, the export policies, and the support provided for yarn exported to the European Union are concerned. It was made clear to him that Syria provided no subsidies for either exporters or producers, and that the export price is similar to that of the local market. </seg>
